# Reviewer_Assignment_Problem_RAP_CoNaIISI
Optimizes reviewer assignment by matching paper abstracts against the evaluators' past publication abstracts.Â This project fetches profiles from Google Scholar, generates BGE-M3 embeddings, and runs an OR-Tools (Min Cost Flow) optimization model to assign tasks based on semantic affinity, load, and affiliation conflict constraints.
